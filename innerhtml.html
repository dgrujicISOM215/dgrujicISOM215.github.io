This is all still new to me I am just getting started with these types of classes. Github is now seen as a great resource for me and I will probably continue to use it from now on even outside of class. I will be graduating this upcoming May so I hope to maybe show some skills that I have learned within this class. It's rare to be able to show proof of knowing something outside of class literally but this class gives me that opportunity.

Then I dressed and off we flew to New York to meet some girls. As we rode in the bus in the weird phosphorescent void of the Lincoln Tunnel we leaned on each other with fingers waving and yelled and talked excitedly, and I was beginning to get the bug like Dean.";
