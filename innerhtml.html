<p id=pid1>
This is all still new to me I am just getting started with these types of classes. Github is now seen as a great resource for me and I will probably continue to use it from now on even outside of class. I will be graduating this upcoming May so I hope to maybe show some skills that I have learned within this class. It's rare to be able to show proof of knowing something outside of class literally but this class gives me that opportunity.

Click the button below

<a onclick="changepid1();" href="#top">Change Paragraph #1</a>

<script type="text/javascript">

function changepid1() 

{ 
// DEBUG Statement
//alert("foobar");

//
// Change the text of the first paragraph...
//
document.getElementById("pid1").innerHTML="Now that it's been a couple weeks within this class I can say that I have learned the early beginnings of github and hope to learn even more. I hope this change of paragraph works as well so that I can get the full homework grade. One of the past assignments didn't really workout to well for me so hopefully this transfers. ";

// Example of changing a paragraphs color using a <span> tag
	var oldHTML = document.getElementById('pid1').innerHTML;
	var newHTML = "<span style='color: green'>" + oldHTML + "</span>";
	document.getElementById('pid1').innerHTML = newHTML;
